When you log in as management you have 2 different options. Go to accounting and stock management. Stock site should just hold a long list of all the different beverages that exist for the pub(maybe have listing options as show beers, wine or spirits and list them either alphbetical, or price wise for easier management). Beside the beverages it should show current stock and also have a button for adding more stock and it will in that case att the beverage to a "cart" with the amount you want to add. You can also remove from stock in the offchance mistakes has been made when inventory has been taken or orders have been faulty. If you click on one beverage you can also get up all the information about the beverage such as price etc. Its also there the manager can change the price of said beverage. The cart will be side bar on right side of the window. There you can change the amount you order och remove from the cart. If we want to implement drag and drop you can also just drag a beverage to the cart button and choose in the side bar how much you want to order.
